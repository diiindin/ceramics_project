## About Project

This is the online shop that sells different ceramic handicrafts. It has various functions, such as:

- Seeing all stuff in the main page
- Categories of the stuff
- Email sending functionality
- Localization
- Adding stuff to the cart
- Uploading a photo [png, jpeg]
- Make an order

In this project I used the php Laravel framework, PHPMyAdmin as a database, bootstrap, jQuery libraries, Heroku.com for deploying, Mailtrap.io for sending messages

## Database

There are two tables: Categories and Products. The ceramics_id is a foreign key that is connecting them. The relation between tables is 'one to many' because each product has only one category and each category may have many produtcs.

My website supports two languages: Russian (main) and English
